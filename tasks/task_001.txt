# Task ID: 1
# Title: Refactor JiraConfig for Per-Request PAT
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the JiraConfig class to remove loading and storage of default Jira PAT, username/API token, and OAuth credentials intended for Jira API authentication. Retain URL, SSL, and proxy configurations.
# Details:
Locate `jira/config.py`. Identify and remove code responsible for loading and storing authentication credentials (PAT, username/token, OAuth) from environment variables or other default sources. Ensure URL, SSL verification settings, and proxy configurations remain intact.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that `JiraConfig` instances no longer store or load authentication secrets. Check that URL, SSL, and proxy settings are still correctly handled.

# Task ID: 8
# Title: Adapt UsersMixin for Per-Request PAT
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Adapt methods in `UsersMixin` (`jira/users.py`) to accept a `pat: str` parameter and use `_create_jira_client_with_pat` for API calls, specifically addressing `get_current_user_account_id`.
# Details:
Modify methods in `UsersMixin` (`_get_account_id`, `get_user_profile_by_identifier`, etc.) to accept `pat: str`. Obtain an authenticated client using `jira_for_call = self._create_jira_client_with_pat(pat)`. Use `jira_for_call` for API interactions. Ensure `get_current_user_account_id` accepts `pat: str` and uses it to identify the user associated with that specific PAT.

# Test Strategy:
Test `get_current_user_account_id` and other user methods with different PATs belonging to different users. Verify that the correct user information is returned based on the provided PAT and that `_create_jira_client_with_pat` is called.

# Task ID: 4
# Title: Adapt get_paged for Per-Request PAT
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the `get_paged` method in `jira/client.py` to accept a `pat: str` parameter and use the newly implemented `_create_jira_client_with_pat` method to obtain an authenticated client for making API calls.
# Details:
Modify the signature of `get_paged` in `jira/client.py` to include `pat: str`. Replace any usage of a default `self.jira` instance with `jira_for_call = self._create_jira_client_with_pat(pat)`. Use `jira_for_call` for all subsequent API calls within the method.

# Test Strategy:
Write a test for `get_paged` that provides a PAT. Verify that it successfully fetches paged results using the provided PAT and that `_create_jira_client_with_pat` is called.
